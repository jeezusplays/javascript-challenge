Are you a front-end engineer looking to improve your Javascript skills? Or perhaps you're a non-front-end engineer looking to learn JavaScript? Then the 30 Days LeetCode Challenge is just for you!

Every day starting May 5, LeetCode will pick one JavaScript problem to solve. Solve the daily problem to win rewards and master basic JavaScript skills. JavaScript beginners are welcome to join the event.
